## SIMULATION
### Nebula Core simulation
Still working in simulation of input data (imem_data) in queue, because multiples input can be real in a OS, so we simulate the Nebula Core with a Input Queue to write in registers, but is in development in this moment.
ADDI and ADD instructions has been simulated and passed of testbench in verilator write in Registers and ALU ADDI/ADD.
### 
STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT, NOT YET SIMULATED FOR ANY USE CASE!
